mandelbrotJS
============

Simple mandelbrot fractal renderer using HTML canvas. 
The goal of making 'yet-another-mandelbrot-renderer' was to have a small and clean implementation, which is easy to comprehend. Unfortunately,
most of existing implementations are either full of magic numbers and 'all-in-one-place' style of programming, and/or feature many additional
options like zooming, which makes it hard to read the code - at least for those who didn't have a solid understanding of Mandelbrot set prior to looking at code. 
This implementation, on the other hand, should be clear to a programmer with non-extensive
mathematial background (such as myself).
